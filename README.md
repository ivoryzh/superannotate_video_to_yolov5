# superannotate_video_to_yolov5
This project is to generate a dataset that is ready for training with yolov5 from superannotate.com video annotation project. 

## situation
Superannote.com has a handy feature of annotating videos, but won't have options converting to a format that is ready for yolov5 training. Roboflow does offer superannotate json to yolov5 txt conversion, but is for images only.
